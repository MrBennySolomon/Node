-----
-Koa-
-----
From the same team of creators behind ExpressJS comes Koa, 
which is a much more customizable alternative to existing NodeJS frameworks.
It is perfect for projects that require flexibility and interoperability.
With async functions, Koa allows you to ditch callbacks, 
which is one of the main points of criticism against Express.
The main difference between Koa and Express is in the way they handle middleware; 
Koa comes without any bundled middleware and requires modules for routing and templates.

---------
-Fastify-
---------
Fastify is another popular open-source web framework for the Node environment that is primarily famous for its speed, i.e., 
it is up to 20% faster than Express in almost every request.
It provides full encapsulation for plug-ins, parses incoming requests into JSON with faster rendering, 
and provides quick routing. 
Fastify also has a cleaner syntax for writing async codes for use as controller code.

------
-Nest-
------
NestJS is a free and open-source Node.js framework that is used to build scalable and efficient server-side applications.
It is inspired by Googleâ€™s Angular and is built with TypeScript, 
a typed superset of JavaScript that allows you to use the concepts of functional, 
functional reactive, and object-oriented programming.
Nest makes it easier to divide the apps into microservices, 
thereby offering a clearer architecture than Express with fewer components.

----------
-Ember JS-
----------
Ember JS is one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks used by some of the top companies like Apple Music, Vine, Twitch, and LinkedIn.
It is considered one of the best in distributor logic; it follows the model-view-ViewModel (MVVM) 
architecture and allows developers to build highly scalable web apps using common idioms.
If the development team behind your project is big, Ember is the ideal JS framework you can use.

------------
-BackboneJS-
------------
Initially released in 2010, 
Backbone has grown consistently in popularity as one of the most viable competitors to Express in the Node.js environment. 
It is a free and open-source JavaScript library with a RESTful interface based on the MVC paradigm.
Backbone is highly lightweight and flexible as it is dependent on only one underlying library, i.e., 
Underscore.js, making it extremely easy to build apps and their front ends using JavaScript.

--------
-Vue JS-
--------
In the list of JavaScript frameworks, Vue is one of the newer alternatives to Express but has been consistently rising in the popularity ranks.
It is also based on the MVVM architecture and offers much more core functionalities despite being one of the lightest JS frameworks available to developers.
Vue offers a familiar templating syntax, which makes integrating and migrating existing projects to it smoother and quicker.

-------------
-Knockout JS-
-------------
Knockout is a pure JavaScript library and a standalone implementation of the MVVM pattern that works with any web framework.
It provides an easy and clean way to handle complex data-driven interfaces with the help of Templates, 
which helps developers build complex UI structures easily.
Some of the most sought after features of Knockout includes declarative bindings, deep browser support, built-in templating support, etc. 

---------
-Angular-
---------
The current iteration of Angular is a complete rewrite of Angular JS, 
which was one of the first full-stack web frameworks in the JavaScript environment.
Angular 2.0, as it is called, is written in TypeScript and is a client-side framework that is primarily used to create single-page web, 
desktop, and mobile apps with HTML strings.
The update also decoupled the DOM from the framework and introduced the use of multiple renderers, 
which enabled rapid development and faster app loading.

--------
-Meteor-
--------
MeteorJS is another full-stack JavaScript framework that is primarily preferred for frontend development like Angular.
It offers developers a complete collection of interdependent libraries that can be used to build websites and web apps rapidly and easily.
Meteor provides a database template and takes care of Express with the help of its template system and Blaze, 
enabling the same capabilities as the MEAN stack.

----------
-Sails JS-
----------
Sails JS is one of the most popular MVC frameworks for the Node JS environment that emulates the MVC pattern of frameworks like Ruby, 
but with the support for the requirements of the modern apps.
It is essentially a lightweight framework that sits on top of Express and enables a uniform API irrespective of the underlying database. 
Like Rails, Sails JS provides an ORM interface which abstracts the database interaction.

------------
-Conclusion-
------------
Express is mainly suitable for highly interactive web projects as it allows developers to build quicker and scalable web apps easily.
If you are going to develop a large project that will be supported by a large team of developers, 
the lack of standardization can be a bottleneck in the productivity of your teams.
So, you will need to thoroughly consider the needs of your project before selecting a web framework for your project.
If you cannot conclude the decision among the best alternatives to ExpressJS on your own, 
consider getting in touch with the experts at one of the leading app hosting companies.
They can help you make an informed decision by carefully assessing your needs and suggest you the best software solutions for your upcoming projects.
